		<h2>About Ocean Acidification</h2>
		<p> Ocean acidification is, as its name suggests, the process by which the ocean becomes more acidic. 
        The way scientists measure acidity is by pH; the “potential of hydrogen” of a particular substance. It is given by the equation: <img src="http://images.tutorvista.com/cms/images/44/ph-formula.png" /><br />

		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure water, which does not release or uptake hydrogen ions, lies at exactly 7 pH, while acidic substances release large amounts of hydrogen ions (pH<7), and basic substances uptake hydrogen ions (pH>
    7). The way this quantity is defined may be slightly misleading, for a small change in pH is given by a massive change in hydrogen ion concentration.<br /><br />

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, human blood has a pH of about 7.35 to 7.45. Dropping this pH level by just 0.2 or 0.3 pH can lead to many health complications, including seizures, comas, and perhaps even death. The same is true of the pH of the ocean, as we shall soon see. [5]<br /><br />

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean acidification is mainly driven by the ocean’s uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. [1] This is accomplished by churning of surface waters, and by waters amazing ability to absorb CO2 . The reason adding CO2 to the ocean decreases pH is given by the reaction<br />

    which progresses forward, adding 2 hydrogen ions, as more CO2 becomes available in the atmosphere.
     As seen in the graph below, the concentration of atmospheric pH is directly correlated with ocean acidity:<br />

		<h3>History of Ocean Acidification</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the surface pH of the ocean has fallen 0.1 pH on average. 
        Since pH is on a logarithmic scale, this translates into a 30% increase in acidity over the past 300 years. [2].
         Based on geologic data, this is the fastest known change in ocean acidity in the last 50 million years. [5].
         Surface waters are expected to increase at an even faster rate during the next century, and some computer models predict we could be facing up to a 150% increase. [2].<br />

		<h4>Effects on the Earth</h4>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason these statistics are so disturbing is how much ocean acidification affects marine organisms.
             According to a recent study [3], ocean acidification is affecting coral structures worldwide. Calcifying corals process CaCO3 (Calcium Carbonate) 
            to form their hard structures. Not only does increasing acidity change biologically usable CO3-2  into unusable HCO3- , 
            but increasing acidity also can dissolve already existing calcium carbonate. [3,5]<br /><br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thwese said coral reefs are some of the most important structures on Earth. 
            They are home to massive amounts of biodiversity and are made of carbonate, and also host many animals that rely on both calcium and carbonate for life. 
            Like calcium ions, hydrogen ions tend to bond with carbonate—but they 
            have a greater attraction to carbonate than calcium. When two hydrogens bond with carbonate, a new molecule called bicarbonate (2HCO3-) is formed.
             Shell-building organisms can't extract the carbonate ion they need from bicarbonate, preventing them from using that carbonate to grow new shell.<br /><br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building of skeletons in marine creatures is particularly sensitive to acidity. 
            One of the molecules that hydrogen ions bond with is carbonate (CO3-2), a key component of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) shells. 
            To make calcium carbonate, shell-building marine animals such as corals and oysters combine a calcium ion (Ca+2) with carbonate 
            (CO3-2) from surrounding seawater, releasing carbon dioxide and water in the process.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hypothesis as to why ocean acidification can cause slower calcification rates (and there are several) 
            is that as seawater pH decreases (leading to protons building up in the external environment), the organisms must exert more energy to 
            rid themselves of the protons produced internally by calcification --- they are simply working against a steeper proton gradient.
            The effects on the bodies of marine animals can be visualized below.<br />

<h5><font size="20">What you can do! </font></h5>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can help reduce ocean acidification today by finding ways to reduce your carbon and nutrient footprints.
        The carbon footprint of the average household in the United States, with average size and similar income, is 48.5 tons of CO2 per year. 
        Fueling up cars and powering up homes are where our emissions start to add up. But there are other, less obvious, ways that also contribute, 
        such as consuming a lot of red meat and dairy products. <br /><br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be very simple and can easily be practiced by anyone. A few good ways to reduce your personal carbon footprint include:<br />
       <li> Avoiding traffic, which you want to do anyway<br />
        <li>
            Driving a low carbon vehicle
        <br />
        <li>
            Not driving! Walk or bike if possible
        <br />
        <li>
            Drive more passively, acceleration burns more fuel and releases CO<sub>2</sub>
        <br />
        <li>
            Turn off lights and utilities at home when not in use
        <br />
        <li>
            Go solar
        <br /><br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practicing any or all of these is a good start to protecting our beautiful oceans and the life in them.<br /><br />
            This is what we can keep by protecting our oceans:<br />

            This is what we're heading toward:<br />

            Save the fish, and their homes!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
